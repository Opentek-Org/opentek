<h1 align="center">Contributing to Events | Projects | Programs</h1>

1. Set up your local environment as mentioned [here](https://github.com/Opentek-Org/opentek/blob/main/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-installation-steps)
2. Open the `event.js` file and in the `data` variable you can see `monthId` and inside it we have `event` where we add our event for that particular month
Our month convention is **0 - January** to **11 - December**

In the picture below we have an event of **January** and the **event** number is 1

According to the above pattern we have to add other events. 

**All the images works good in (1000 * 1000) pixels and store it in ../images/events folder only**

3. If you want to add an event that will be occuring in March then go to `monthId - 2` and create a block as shown and fill all the necessary details.

We will be reviewing each and every PR before it gets merged.

## ðŸ’¯ Adding of PROJECTS and PROGRAMS work the same way!

**If you want to add a domain you can add it inside `domain` array and make necessary changes in `data`**

- Open the Youtube video you want to add.
- The highlighted part is your `id` that we are going to use.
- Copy the id and paste it. Add the necessary details like author, desc and about.
